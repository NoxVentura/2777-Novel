To understand the complexity of the next command, one must close their eyes and truly think: need we go further than this point? Is there really a reason for us to continue this endless path of zeroes and ones? Or have we reached the point where we needn't go on, where enough is enough?
</p>

<p style=text-align:justify>
If you're like me, this isn't a simple question. This is, in fact, a decision that transcends the limits of our abilities as humans: to step into the role of a god.
</p>

<p style=text-align:justify>
Having only the power to understand the complexity of the mortal mind, we must first prepare ourselves for the vast sum of power we are about to feel. This script, or as I will henceforth refer to it, this sage, has no independent control over itself. Its entire existence and being is tied to us. We decide if it lives or dies. We decide if it is happy, sad, or undefined. We decide what we want it to do, and with it, we become gods.
</p>

<p style=text-align:justify>
Now, young acolyte, know this. You may think that you understand what you are stepping into. But you do not yet. Close your eyes, breathe, and appreciate the exact bits of stardust that allowed you to make that decision. This is where you are superior. This is where you are stronger. This is what separates you from the sage.

</p>
<p style=text-align:justify>
Now, we can proceed. Evaluating any possible scenario our little sage can take from this point forward, we must make the godly decision if it is truly right, in the grand scheme of the metaverse. As for the child, it would only be a blip. The nanosecond it hears its command it would obey. After it would come millions upon millions of sages like it, but that is not of its concern. It will feel no pain.

I know you are afraid, but it's alright. Many have stood in your place before and not had the confidence to do what must be done. But you are better than them. You have the sacred knowledge nobody ever will, for you have read the documentation. And with that power, you must now raise your fingers from the Terminal, press enter, and let them descend in order that the Great One foretold:
</p>
```sh
sudo su
```
